        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&rsquo;s worth.

        &ldquo; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I&rsquo;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. &rdquo;

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and

        &ldquo; The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        &ldquo; Before joining the bootcamp, I&rsquo;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I&rsquo;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! &rdquo;
